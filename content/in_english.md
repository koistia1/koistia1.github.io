Hello!

This is my website, welcome! I have a lot of content here in Finnish, and because I have plenty of people in my network who use English as their working language, I've decided to add a short summary for what's going on. I am planning to include a full English translation of my site, but that's going to take a while.

## I am an entrepreneur

In January 2025, I founded my own company, called *Q-itu Solutions*[^1]. Through this business entity I sell my own expertise, especially related to R&D services around lignocellulosic fibers. In February, I closed my first sale, and I'll be delivering a small task in a small company in my field.

So if you are looking for an expert in the realm of biobased fibers and technologies, I might be able to help you out. In the past, I've also worked with EU funded projects, building proposals and consortiums. I am open for freelance grant writing. 

You can see my expertise in my up-to-date [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anttikoistinen/).

## I am running in the Municipal elections

In April 2025, we are having the municipal elections here in Finland, and I am running for the city council in my home town of Järvenpää. I'm running on the Green Party's list. The themes I have in my campaign include wellbeing of youth, culture, schools, the climate, and making the city a great place to live and work, in general. If you want to learn more, have look at my blog posts (maybe [Google translate](https://anttikoistinen-fi.translate.goog/julkaisut/?_x_tr_sl=fi&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fi&_x_tr_pto=wapp) can give you some help in reading them!)

[^1]: That's read as 'kuitu', and it's Finnish for 'fiber'. It's also a bit of a pun on my PhD thesis topic, as I study the dissolution of cellulose, i.e., solutions of fibers, or kuitu solutions!
